## Overview

The ALPS/looper package is one of the applications of the ALPS Project. 
The ALPS/looper is the successor of the Looper Library version 2,
which is the Fortran 90 library for quantum Monte Carlo method.

The ALPS/looper application provides multi-cluster quantum Monte Carlo
algorithms for generic spin systems in the path-integral or SSE
representations.  it supports generic spin models with arbitrary spin
size *S* on arbitrary lattices. The supported interactions are

* XXZ two-spin interaction (Ising, Heisenberg, XY)
* XYZ two-spin interaction (requires recompilation)
* single-ion anisotropy (D-term) for *S* > 1/2
* longitudinal magnetic field
* transverse matnetic field

Since it supports so-called *freezing graphs*, models with easy-axis
(Ising-like) anisotropy can also be simulated very efficiently.

From version 4, it includes non-trivial hybrid parallelization by
using MPI and OpenMP, which has been tested on several state-of-the-art
supercomputers (K computer, SGI Altix, etc).

A stripped version of the ALPS/looper is distributed as a part of ALPS.
The full version of ALPS/looper library (including test suites, etc) is
available from [http://wistaria.github.io/alps-looper/](http://wistaria.github.io/alps-looper/).

## Installation

Note: This section applies only for the full version of ALPS/looper.

### Prerequisites

* [ALPS](http://alps-comp-phys.org) -- version 2.0 or higher
  
### Download
  
[https://github.com/wistaria/alps-looper/releases](https://github.com/wistaria/alps-looper/releases)

### Compilation

```sh
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$ALPS_HOME $LOOPER_SRC_DIR
$ make
```

where `$ALPS_HOME` denotes the top directory in which the ALPS package is installed, `$LOOPER_SRC_DIR` is the directory where the source code of the ALPS/looper is located.

CMake accepts the following configuration options:

In addition, the lattice/model descriptions can require further parameters (e.g. L or W) as specified in the lattice (model) description file.

## Temperature Annealing

Some models (typically models with competing interactions) have very long equilibration time.  In such cases, one might want to lower the temperature slowly during the thermalization steps.  Such temperature annealing process can be specified by using the parameters T\_START\_\# and T\_DURATION\_\# (\# = 0, 1, 2,...), where T\_START\_\# and \T\_DURATION\_\# specify the starting temperature and the duration of the \# th block, respectively.

![anneal](anneal.jpg)

For example the protocol shown in the above figure can be realized by specifing the following parameter set.

```
T_START_0 = 2.0;
T_DURATION_0 = 100;
T_START_1 = 1.5;
T_DURATION_1 = 400;
THERMALIZATION = 1000;
T = 1.2;
```

Note that the sum of T\_DURATION\_\#'s must be less than or equal to THERMALIZATION.

A few remarks concerning the generalized susceptibilities: The general idea is that the uniform generalized susceptibility is the susceptibility for the magnetic order supposed to be stronger.  The staggered generalized susceptibility is the staggered susceptibility of this specific order.  To be more precise, we have the following correspondance:

| Model | Generalized Susceptibility | Generalized Staggered Susceptibility |
|:------|:---------------------------|:-----------------------------------------|
| Ferromagnetic model with Ising anisotropy (in the *Z* axis) | uniform *Z-Z* susceptibility | staggered *Z-Z* susceptibility |
Ferromagnetic model (Heisenberg point) | uniform *Z-Z* (or *X-X*) susceptibility | staggered *Z-Z* (or *X-X*) susceptibility |
| Ferromagnetic model with XY anisotropy (in the *XY* plane) | uniform *X-X* susceptibility | staggered *X-X* susceptibility |
| Antiferromagnetic model with XY anisotropy (in the *XY* plane) | staggered *X-X* susceptibility             uniform *X-X* susceptibility |
| Antiferromagnetic model (Heisenberg point) | staggered *Z-Z* (or *X-X*) susceptibility | uniform *Z-Z* (or *X-X*) susceptibility |
| Antiferromagnetic model with Ising anisotropy (in the *Z* axis) | staggered *Z-Z* susceptibility | uniform *Z-Z* susceptibility |

Same considerations apply for the uniform and staggered magnetization to the square.
